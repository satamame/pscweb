# pscweb
- This is an ongoing project.
- Using Django as web framework.

## Notes
- So far its concept is messed up as the result of snappy development for practical use.
    - The schedule data is dynamically read from Google spreadsheet (as the master data) and the basic definitions (team members, rehearsal date) are on the model DB.

## Python environment
- You can `pipenv install` (or `pipenv sync`) to create a virtual env.
